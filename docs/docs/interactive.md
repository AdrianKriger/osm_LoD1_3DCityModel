# Interactive Visualization
{: .no_toc }


The Jupyter environment allows for easy customization of a dynamic visualization. The example `iframe` below illustrates building stock differentiated through color. A school, housing, retail, healthcare and community focused facilities are easily identified while the tooltips highlight the underlying data. Additional features unique to an aoi can also be included. Here farmland, streams, recreational spaces and bus rapid transit routes have been added *- you are thus limited only through data and your imagination*. <!-- {: .fs-6 .fw-300 } -->

**on a laptop without a mouse**:

- `trackpad left-click drag-left` and `-right`;
- `Ctrl left-click drag-up`, `-down`, `-left` and `-right` to rotate and so-on and
- `+` next to Backspace zoom-in and `-` next to `+` zoom-out.
