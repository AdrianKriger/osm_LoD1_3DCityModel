# Acknowledgement and Parting Shots
{: .no_toc }  

This work is inspired by [3dfier](https://tudelft3d.github.io/3dfier/minimal_data_requirements.html); product of the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/)

Its [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02866): `Ledoux H, Biljecki F, Dukai B, Kumar K, Peters R, Stoter J, and Commandeur T (2021). 3dfier: automatic reconstruction of 3D city models. Journal of Open Source Software, 6(57), 2866.` [website](https://tudelft3d.github.io/3dfier/index.html) and [github](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) are available.

With regard to village/campus; [BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) offers some (if not all and more) of this functionality while [Cesium](https://cesium.com/), [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) and [3dbuildings](https://3dbuildings.com/) will stream 3D tiles to your hearts content.
