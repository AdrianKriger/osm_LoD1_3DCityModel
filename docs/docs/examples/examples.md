# Examples

To ease the use of this workflow a range of parameter files *---with various settings---* are available. `runtime` timing metrics, for an aged and clunky [intel i5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors), are included. 

All raster DEM used in the examples are sourced from the [CD:NGI Geoportal](http://www.ngi.gov.za/index.php/online-shop/what-is-itis-portal); State copyright reserved. The [Chief Directorate: National Geospatial Information](http://www.ngi.gov.za/) is a branch of the [Department Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development](https://www.dalrrd.gov.za/) and is a key contributor to the [South African Spatial Data Infrustructure](http://www.sasdi.gov.za/sites/SASDI/Pages/Home.aspx).
