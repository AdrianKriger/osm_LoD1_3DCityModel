# Neighbourhood
{: .no_toc }

---

A City Model of a tiny urban community of 300 homes (1000 residents) with the [osm tag](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) `place:neighbourhood` is possible with [osm3DuEstate_param.json](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/osm_LoD1_3DCityModel/blob/main/village_campus/extra/osm3DuEstate_param.json). 

`runtime: 0:01:20` with a 25-m elevation model and `0:01:43` with a 10-m elevation model.  

The interactive version will follow the same logic as [village/campus interactiveOnly.ipynb](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/osm_LoD1_3DCityModel/blob/main/village_campus/interactiveOnly.ipynb)
